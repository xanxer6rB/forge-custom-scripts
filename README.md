# INTRO
Hello all,
It's been a long time since I've updated this and have now created a git repo that contains the various Horde format files and other custom formats and even some custom formats like some of the starwars the gathering sets.

The format card scripts are very much still a working in progress.

The card script I primarily use as my main Horde format is "hordelikeformat". It has the basic Horde format rules but with some custom additions. Add this card to any of your decks and start a match. When the match starts the card will trigger and a serious of questions and choice scripts will follow.

I welcome any contributions to the scripts or suggestions to help improve/optimize them to make them more playable for the Ai or even adding features to the format(s).

# forge-custom-scripts
Custom forge scripts to run different types of card formats and custom sets

Add suggested card script to your library before starting a match. 
 - Each script more or less work but are still wip.
 - Formats you can play include:
     - Horde
       - Basic rules:
       - For a more customized Horde format use: hordeformatlike
     - Face the Hydra Challenge: Challenge 1 - FaceTheHydra_Rev3
     - Battle the Horde Challenge: Challenge 2 - Battle the Horde_Rev2
     - Defeat a God Challenge: Challenge 3 Defeat a God Rev2
     - Random other formats for testing

I have also been trying to script some already existing custom sets like:
- StarWars the Gathering
- Zelda
- Pokemon

To use files just add them to your custom folder
