Add suggested card script to your library before starting a match. 
 - Each script more or less work but are still wip.
 - Formats you can play include:
     - A customized Horde like format use: hordeformatlike
     - Face the Hydra Challenge: Challenge 1 - FaceTheHydra_Rev3
     - Battle the Horde Challenge: Challenge 2 - Battle the Horde_Rev2

To use files just add them to your custom folder

I welcome any contributions to the scripts or suggestions to help improve/optimize them to help make them run smoother and more playable for the Ai or even adding features to the format(s).
