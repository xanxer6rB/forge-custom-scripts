# forge-custom-scripts
Custom forge scripts to run different types of card formats and custom sets
 - Each script more or less work but are still wip.
 - Formats you can play include:
     - Horde
     - Face the Hydra Challenge
     - Battle the Horde Challenge
     - Defeat a God Challenge
     - Random other formats for testing

I have also been trying to script some already existing custom sets like:
- StarWars the Gathering
- Zelda
- Pokemon

To use files just add them to your custom folder
