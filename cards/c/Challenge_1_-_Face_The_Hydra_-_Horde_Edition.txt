#	TODO: How Many Heads? Hydra Horde By: Namu342 #

#		Preface:
#	The most important thing to keep in mind with these rules is that they are not concrete rules.
#	Please adjust based on playgroup or strength of decks used against the horde deck.

#		Rules

#		Setup:
#CHK	1. Each Survivor contributes 20 life(To be determined based on more testing, but with ~5 damage
#		a turn from just hydra heads seems like it will be painful enough).
#CHK	2. Hydra horde begins with 5 Hydra heads in play chosen at random.

#		Gameplay:
#TESTING	1. The Survivors always go first, and take the first three turns before the Horde gets a turn.
#		The Survivors do not get to draw on their first turn.
#	2. Due to the nature of the hydra heads dealing damage for being untapped, they will be the only
#		creatures to not to attack each turn, but instead will always block. If hydra heads are tapped
#		due to an effect and no creatures are available to block all incoming damage is directed to a
#		hydra based on a players choice.
#CHK	3. All creatures have haste. The Horde has infinite mana, and will pay all costs for cards such
#		as Propaganda or Rhystic Study. Also hyrdras with an activated ability will use it once a turn per
#		hydra(to be adjusted based on testing/difficulty)
#TESTING	4. Whenever a hydra head is destroyed the hydra horde deck reveals the top 5 cards of its library
#		and any heads/hydras(x=to number of hydra turns) that are revealed will be put into play all
#		other cards will placed into the graveyard.
#CHK	6. Each hydra head deals 1 damage to each opponent and each elite hydra head deals 2 to damage to each opponent.

#		Winning the Game (all conditions must be met):
#CHK	1. The Horde must have no cards in its library.
#CHK	2. The Horde must have no cards in hand.
#CHK	3. The Horde must have no creatures in play.

#		Additional Rules Notes:
#	1. If a card is returned to the Horde's hand, it is cast during their next main phase.
#CHKish	2. The Horde is supposed to be mindless, so whenever possible, make choices
#		randomly.
#TESTING	3. If a Hydra Head is exiled instead it is placed in the graveyard instead.(Heads need to regrow :)).

#		Deck-Specific Rules
#	1. The horde's turn proceeds in this manner:
#	a) Upkeep -The hydra deck reveals the top 5(tbd) card of its library and plays all spells revealed this way
#		in a random order. Also every upkeep the hydra horde gains X+1 for its hydra creature
#		spells(due to limiting the use of infinite mana to cast the hydra creatures)
#	b) First main phase - The hydra player will cast any card that has been returned to its hand, cast in a random order.
#		Cards with flashback may also be played at this point.
#	c) Combat phase - All non hydra head creatures will attack(creatures have haste).
#	d) Second main phase - Any cards drawn or returned to hand during the first main phase are now cast.
#	2. If the Horde would gain life, it puts one card per life gained from the bottom of its graveyard on the bottom of
#		its library in a random order.
#	3. If the Horde would ever discard a card, it is done at random.
#
#       My Own Added Rules
#CHK   1. Hydra spells the Hydra casts cost 4 less
#   2. Whenever Hydra casts a spell with {X} in its mana cost, The Hydra creates a 0/0 Hydra token, then put X +1/+1 counters on it.
#CHK   3. Heads the Hydra controls have {T}: Add {1} mana of any one color.
