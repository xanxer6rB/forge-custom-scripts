# TODO: Emblems: Use a card (like a Swamp or Infect token) to represent an bonus for the horde. 
#	Each time one is revealed, the horde gets a bonus to make it more powerful. Some people treat 
#	the emblem as an extra turn, one extra reveal from the horde deck, or an emblem which gives the 
#	horde an extra reveal each turn. Depending on how powerful they are for your meta, you can choose 
#	to give the horde the emblem if they reveal it from a flip, or even 
#	when it gets milled to the graveyard.
