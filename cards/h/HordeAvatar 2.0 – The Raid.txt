# GAME START EVENTS
T:Mode$ NewGame | ValidPlayer$ Opponent | Execute$ DBBoss | TriggerDescription$ When the game starts you will be prompt to select your first Legendary creature that will act as a "Boss" and then prompt to choose a color. The color chosen will grab all cards from the Hordes library and stack it on top of your selected "Boss". You can do this as many times as you want but 5 is suggested with having the idea of stacking one color onto the previously chosen color and having a "Boss" at the end of each color. Time to Build your Adventure. Lets get started.
